Genetics is the branch of biology that studies how traits are passed on
from one generation to the next and why there are similarities and
differences between related individuals. Prior to the discovery of
genes, scientists knew that parents passed something down to their
offspring, but they did not know how or what. Gregor Mendel’s famous
experiments with peas indicated that certain features, such as pea
texture and flower color, are encoded by two sets of traits and that the
parental traits can be separated. Decades later, scientists discovered
that parents passed down DNA, which was present in chromosomes. Since
the discovery of DNA, we have come to appreciate the importance of
chromosomes. Genomics is a relatively new field with the bold aim of
understanding the function of every single gene in a genome, including
the human genome. This field took off with the completion of the first
sequenced genome, and after the completion of the Human Genome Project,
it has attracted increasing research. Mendelian inheritance can be
explained with the movement of the chromosomes during cell division. We
have learned that sperm and eggs carry these chromosomes into the
offspring during sexual reproduction and that genes located on those
chromosomes code for the traits that make us unique. Mainly, meiosis –
the germ line specific form of cell division – is responsible for a
great variety of offspring during sexual reproduction. In this course,
we will discuss inheritance patterns where the recessive and dominant
alleles do not matter at all. For example, in the case of imprinting,
the only thing that matters is the origin of the allele: some genes are
always maternal (it does not matter what allele the father contributes),
while other genes are always paternal (it does not matter what allele
the mother contributes). Finally, the ultimate departure from Mendel is
epigenetic inheritance: the environment induced post-synthetic nucleic
DNA modification results in phenotypes that are not written in the DNA
sequence. We will also take a close look at chromosomes, DNA, and genes.
We will learn about Mendelian and non-Mendelian genetics, the movement
of the chromosomes, and the location and mutation of genes in a
chromosome. We will learn how hereditary information is transferred, how
it can change, how it can lead to human disease, and how it can be
tested to indicate disease. Genetic diseases may be diagnosed with
karyotyping in the case of aneuploidy or with the help of a genetic test
specifically developed to diagnose mutated alleles. It is important that
researchers and physicians fully understand mitosis and meiosis, the two
fundamental replication cycles, and that they are able to find out how
to control each step in order to help prevent disease. Genetic tests are
based on bioengineering technology, and bioengineering technology is
also used for the production of genetically modified organisms.
Bacterial genetics is essential to the production of recombinant DNA;
thus, you will take closer look at how non-bacterial sequences can be
introduced into bacteria. Recombinant DNA technology has been used to
make genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Many of these GMOs are
designed with usefulness for humans in mind. GMOs have their dark side
as well: due to their advantageous acquired trait(s), some GMOs
contribute to the decrease of biodiversity and may elicit adverse
allergic reactions in uninformed individuals. Finally, you will study
the genetic and phenotypic diversity of populations. You will use the
laws of inheritance to explain why trait and allele frequencies change
as a result of environmental pressure. We will look at examples of human
populations with unusually high frequency of a disease and employ
population genetics to explain why the particular disease is more common
in the population. At the end of this course, you will know quite a bit
about the most basic units of heredity – the very molecules that make us
who we are.

    Division”](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/cell-division)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Please pay special attention to Unit 1 and Unit 2, as these lay the
groundwork for understanding the more advanced, exploratory material
presented in the latter units. You will also need to complete:

-   Unit 4 Assessment
-   Unit 6 Assessment
-   Unit 7 Assessment
-   Unit 8 Assessment
-   Unit 9 Assessment
-   Final Exam

Please note that you will only receive an official grade on your final
exam. However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will
need to work through the problem sets within the above-listed
assessments. In order to pass this course, you will need to earn a 70%
or higher on the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as
soon as you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it
again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately **142.75 hours** to complete. There is approximately 12.75
hours of optional material. Each unit includes a time advisory that
lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.
These should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to
take a look at these time advisories, to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you approximately 9
hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete subunits 1.1 and 1.2 (a total of 4.25 hours) on
Monday night; subunits 1.3 through 1.7 (a total of 2.5 hours) on Tuesday
night; subunits 1.8 and 1.9 (a total of 2.25 hours) on Wednesday night;
etc.
