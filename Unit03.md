**Unit 3: Extension of Mendelian Genetics** <span id="3"></span> 

*Believe it or not, after Mendel published his groundbreaking work in
1866, his findings were forgotten for a few decades. It was not until
1900 that his work was rediscovered independently by Correns and de
Vries. Additional research throughout the years would reveal that there
are many types of gene inheritance and expression besides Mendelian
inheritance. Thanks to advances in science and research, many of these
types have been discovered and researched in detail. For example, we
have learned about incomplete dominance, where a white flower mated with
a red flower yields pink offspring. We have also learned about
codominance, where there is more than one dominant allele, as there is
in our blood type system (O, A, B, AB).  
    
 In this unit, we will discuss single and multigenic inheritance
patterns that result in non-Mendelian phenotype distribution. In some
cases, e.g., sex-linked genes and lethal alleles, a missing homologous
chromosome or a missing homozygote (missing because it is lethal) cause
the unexpected offspring phenotype distribution. Other inheritance
patterns truly depart from Mendel’s recessive-dominant inheritance
schemas, e.g., codominance allows two expressed allele traits and
incomplete dominance results in an in-between phenotype. We will also
discuss inheritance patterns where the recessive and dominant alleles do
not matter at all. For example, in the case of imprinting, the only
thing that matters is the origin of the allele; some genes are always
maternal (it does not matter what allele the father contributes), while
other genes are always paternal (it does not matter what allele the
mother contributes). Finally, the ultimate departure from Mendel is
epigenetic inheritance: the environment induced post-synthetic nucleic
DNA modification results in phenotypes that are not written in the DNA
sequence.*

    [“Question & Answer:
    Epistasis”](http://jbiol.com/content/8/4/35) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this series of questions and answers about
    epistasis. Note that, in the case of epistasis, an allele of another
    gene masks the expression of a trait. For example, the fur color of
    a rodent is predicted based on the presence of alleles that are
    responsible for the pigment production; however, the pigments must
    be delivered to the hair, and this process is controlled by another
    gene. The second gene has an allele that does not allow pigment
    delivery to the hair; thus, this allele masks the pigment-dependent
    phenotype. Enlarge and study all of the figures on this webpage.

     Instructions: Read this article. Note that polygenic inheritance
    typically results in continuous phenotype. If alleles of only one
    gene determine a phenotype, then the phenotype has discrete
    values – e.g., Mendelian inheritance, incomplete dominance, and
    complete dominance. Epistasis also results in discrete values of a
    phenotype.

    acknowledged with a short explanation. If your answer is wrong, you
    will be taken to a tutorial page. Study the tutorial page carefully.
