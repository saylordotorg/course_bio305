**Unit 6: The Internal Structure of Genes** <span id="6"></span> 

*From the late 1950s to the 1980s, scientists were attempting to crack
the genetic code and determine what base pair combinations made up what
genes. Ultimately, this involved work by Matthew Meselson and Frank
Stahl, who unraveled the mystery of DNA replication in the cell. By
knowing how DNA is replicated, scientists can artificially mimic the
process. Additional discoveries by Arthur Kornberg and Hamilton Smith of
DNA replication and restriction enzymes – combined with the new
technique of sequencing by Frederick Sanger – finally unlocked the
secret of the genetic code. From this point on, scientists could
determine the order of base pairs for selected DNA regions.  
    
 Once scientists could figure out what genes were located where, they
could then begin to combine DNA from different organisms. This is the
recombinant DNA technology, which is commonly used today, creating such
interesting products as glowing bacteria, Bt corn, broccoflower, and
other useful combinations. Many of these genetically modified organisms
(GMOs) are designed with usefulness for humans in mind. GMOs have their
dark side as well: due to their advantageous acquired trait(s), some
GMOs contribute to the decrease of biodiversity and they may elicit
adverse allergic reaction in uninformed individuals*

*Genetic analysis of organisms today is mainstream technology, and
almost every university and college lab have the capability to either
conduct genetic research or partner with someone who can. By the end of
this unit, you should have a good understanding of the different
techniques used today and what they can tell us about the organisms
under study.*
