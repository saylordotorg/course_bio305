**Unit 2: Mitosis and Meiosis** <span id="2"></span> 

*Unit 1 gave you a foundation of Mendel’s discoveries on which to build.
As we move through the genetic concepts of this unit, we will also
discuss some of the history that led Mendel’s work to be applied to the
chromosome. In this unit, you will learn how Mendel and subsequent work
by other scientists led to the concept of genes and chromosomes through
investigations of mitosis and meiosis.  
  *  
 Mitosis *is the cell replication that results in two daughter cells
that are identical to each other and to the parent cell. Every cell in
your body has the ability to undergo mitosis, and most replicate tens of
times before dying. Mitosis is a multistep process that can lead to
cancer when errors occur. Almost all cancers are cells undergoing
uncontrollable mitosis; cancer cells are immortal.*

*   
 On the other hand,* meiosis *is the cell replication that results in
four unique daughter cells that are different from each other as well as
from the parent cell. Meiosis is also a multistep process, and it leads
to the production of germ cells: sperm and egg cells. If meiosis goes
awry, it can result in genetic defects but more likely in miscarriage.*

*   
 As a result, it is important that researchers and physicians fully
understand mitosis and meiosis, the two fundamental replication cycles,
and that they are able to find out how to control each step in order to
help prevent disease.*
