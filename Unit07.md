**Unit 7: Bacterial Genetics** <span id="7"></span> 
*Scientists have come to understand bacterial genetics. Bacteria are
prokaryotes, and they multiple by binary fission. Binary fission is a
form of asexual reproduction, and it differs from mitosis at the
molecular level. Different bacterial species can exchange their DNA
through several mechanisms; this bacterial feature has been essential in
the development of recombinant DNA technology. We have learned to
introduce new genes into bacteria. In fact, bacteria with designed genes
can do useful things for us. For example, researchers have introduced
petroleum-consuming genes to bacteria in the hopes of creating
recombinant bacteria capable of quickly and efficiently cleaning up oil
spills.*
