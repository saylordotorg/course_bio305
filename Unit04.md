**Unit 4: Linkage Mapping** <span id="4"></span> 

*We are going to discuss the location of genes on the chromosome, what
we mean by crossing over, how this is related to Mendel’s idea of
independent assortment, and how we can use this information to map the
location of genes on the chromosomes. Thomas Hunt Morgan first
constructed genetic maps in his lab in 1910, and then McClintock
discovered transposons in 1931.*

 

*Chromosome mapping started when scientists studying meiosis and the
transfer of genetic material realized that if two genes were next to one
another on a chromosome, then the particular alleles carried on those
two genes were more likely to be passed on together than two genes far
apart on a chromosome. This is because during the recombination stage of
meiosis, genes that are closer to one another are more likely to become
inherited together and thus passed on. Scientists can apply math to this
linking of inheritance in genes and can map the order of genes on a
chromosome based on the phenotype of the offspring.*

**4.1 Crossing Over and Genetic Recombination** <span id="4.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Dr. John W. Kimball’s *Biology Pages*: “Crossing Over and
    Genetic Recombination in Meiosis”**
    Link: Dr. John W. Kimball’s *Biology Pages*: [“Crossing Over and
    Genetic Recombination in
    Meiosis”](http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/CrossingOver.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this article for an introduction to the
    mechanism behind how crossing over happens, according to the most
    recent scientific data.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 1 hour.

**4.2 Relating Cross Over Frequency to Distance on Chromosomes** <span

**4.2.1 Mapping on the X Chromosome** <span id="4.2.1"></span> 
-   **Reading: Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Professor Chris
    Kaiser’s “Lecture 6: Recombination and Genetic Maps”**
    Link: Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Professor Chris
    Kaiser’s [“Lecture 6: Recombination and Genetic
    Maps”](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-03-genetics-fall-2004/lecture-notes/) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Select the PDF link for “Lecture 6: Recombination and
    Genetic Maps,” read these lecture notes. Note that genes that are on
    the same chromosome may separate during meiosis as result of
    crossing over. This text discusses mapping on the X chromosome in
    male fruit flies; this can be scored directly, because male fruit
    flies carry only one copy of the X chromosome. This text is
    technical, so please plan to read it several times for a full
    understanding.  
        
     Reading these lecture notes should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

**4.2.2 Mapping on the Autosomes** <span id="4.2.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Professor Chris
    Kaiser’s “Lecture 7: Three-Factor Crosses”**
    Link: Massachusetts Institute of Technology: Professor Chris
    Kaiser’s [“Lecture 7: Three-Factor
    Crosses”](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/biology/7-03-genetics-fall-2004/lecture-notes/) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Select the PDF link for “Lecture 7: Three-Factor
    Crosses,” and read these lecture notes. These lecture notes discuss
    mapping the distance of two genes on the autosomes using
    heterozygote parents. Next, these lecture notes discuss mapping the
    distance of three genes by using parents that are heterozygotes for
    all three genes; this is called *three-factor cross*. This text is
    technical, so please plan to read it several times for a full
    understanding.  
        
     Reading these lecture notes should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Select the PDF link for “Lecture 8: Tetrad Analysis,”
    read these lecture notes. These lecture notes explain how to
    determine from experimental data whether two genes are linked or
    unlinked. These lecture notes explain the expected phenotype when
    only Mendel’s laws of segregation and independent assortment
    determine the phenotypes of the offspring, and these notes also
    explain the expected offspring phenotype when crossing over plays a
    role. This text is technical, so please plan to read it several
    times for a full understanding.  
        
     Reading these lecture notes should take approximately 1 hour and 30

     Instructions: Selec the PDF link for “Lecture 29: Statistical
    Evaluation of Linkage I,” and read these lecture notes. These
    lecture notes use family Huntington disease data to draw conclusions
    about genetic linkage. SSR stands for simple sequence repeats. LOD
    stands for logarithm of odds. LOD is a statistical test that helps
    to draw conclusions on genetic linkage; positive scores suggest
    linkage. This text is technical, so please plan to read it several
    times for a full understanding.  
        
     Reading these lecture notes should take approximately 2 hours.
