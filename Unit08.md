**Unit 8: Eukaryotic Genes and Genomes** <span id="8"></span> 
*Genome refers to the entire DNA content of an organism. There is no
obvious correlation between the complexity of the organism and the size
of the genome. Many genomes are much larger than the human genome. Some
plants and fish have three billion DNA base pairs! About 5% of our
genome codes for protein, while an amazing 95% seemingly does not have
any known function (this 95% is called junk DNA). Genomics is a
relatively new field with the bold aim of understanding the function of
every single gene in a genome, including the human genome. This field
took off with the completion of the first sequenced genome, and after
the completion of the Human Genome Project, it has attracted ever
increasing research. Decades from now, we might very well know not only
which genes determine our phenotype but also an increasing number of
alleles that are risk factors of diseases.*

     Instructions: Read this article, which focuses on the structural
    differences between coding and junk DNA. In genomics, coding DNA is
    used to make proteins. This is what gives us our characteristics and
    every trait we have. However, as researchers have found, we seem to
    have a lot of extra genes, non-coding DNA, which does not seem to
    serve any particular function. Whether this junk DNA does serve a
    purpose will likely not be determined until the structure of coding
    and junk DNA are closely analyzed. (How can you tell if you have
    extra car parts until you take an inventory?) Although there are
    many technical terms, you should still be able to understand the
    main points and the importance of the study.
