**Unit 1: Mendelian Genetics** <span id="1"></span> 
*This first unit consists of an overview of Gregor Mendel’s ideas about
genetics, published in 1886. Mendel discovered that the traits of a
parent could be separated, that there were two sets of traits in each
parent (one given by a mother; one given by a father), and that one set
of traits might be dominant over the other. His observations of the
segregation and dominance of traits are crucial to understanding how
traits are passed on. Mendel also found that traits were inherited in
ratios that could be predicted by simple math.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   use a Punnett Square to predict the offspring genotype and
    phenotype;
-   identify the phenotype of the offspring in monohybrid and dihybrid
    crosses;
-   identify the genotype of the offspring in monohybrid and dihybrid
    crosses;
-   construct human pedigrees, and characterize inheritance based on the
    pedigree pattern; and
-   use the rules of addition and multiplication to predict the
    probability of offspring with a certain genotype and/or phenotype.

     Instructions: Read this article, which will prepare you to work
    through the probability problems at the end of this unit. The
    Punnett Square was never meant to be used to solve real genetics
    problems; it is only a teaching tool. As you saw in the previous
    subunit, once you get into crosses with three genes or more, things
    get messy. Probability is another way to identify and explain
    Mendel’s genetic patterns. This is generally recommended for more
    complicated genetics problems. This reading will give you a great
    introduction to probability.  
        
     Reading this article should take approximately 30 minutes.
