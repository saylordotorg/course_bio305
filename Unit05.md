**Unit 5: Chromosomal Genetics and Structure** <span id="5"></span> 
*Karyotyping is the study of the physical structure of chromosomes that
can be observed through staining. Although karyotyping has been around
since the 1800s, it took until the 1950s to understand that humans had
46 chromosomes. Our entire genome resides in chromosomes. The human
genome consists of 22 pairs of chromosomes and a pair of sex
chromosomes; two X chromosomes mean a female, while an XY combination
means a male. When a baby does not have exactly 46 chromosomes, any
number of diseases can result, but most commonly aneuploidy is lethal.
For example, when a baby has less than 46 chromosomes, genetic defects
arise. Extra or missing copies of sex chromosomes also result in
disease. Down syndrome occurs in the event of trisomy 21, where there
are three copies of chromosome 21. In addition, pieces of chromosomes
can sometimes be missing, duplicated, or even transferred to another
chromosome, which also results in disease.*
