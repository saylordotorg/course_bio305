**Unit 9: Population and Evolutionary Genetics** <span id="9"></span> 
*This last unit will focus on the relationship between genetics,
populations of organisms, and evolution. Our modern understanding of
evolution would not be complete without understanding the genetics of
evolutionary change. In this unit, we will look at some of the
genetics-related topics associated with evolution. We will begin by
discussing the genetics of a population of organisms. Because the
frequencies of the traits in a population change with time to adapt to
the environment, we know that the frequencies of the alleles producing
these traits must also be changing. Accordingly, this unit focuses on
studies of allele frequency change over time within a population. We
will look at examples of human populations with unusually high frequency
of a disease, and we will employ population genetics to explain why the
particular disease is more common in the population.*

    prevalent, carriers are likely to survive and are thus likely to
    have children with sickle-cell anemia.
